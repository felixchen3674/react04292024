JS is a single threaded call stack

Call stack is a data structure which records where in the program we are.



    underscore :
    The underscore (_) is commonly used as a placeholder or a convention to indicate that 
    a variable is being ignored or its value is not relevant in a particular context. 
    It's often used in scenarios like destructuring assignments where you want to exclude a specific property.
    In the context of object destructuring, using _ as a variable name indicates that you're ignoring the value assigned to it.

    Hash (#):
    symbol is used in JavaScript as a prefix for private class fields and methods. 
    It's used to define private members in classes, which are accessible only within the class itself and not from outside the class or its instances.
