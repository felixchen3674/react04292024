## what is box model

In web design, the CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree and determines how they interact in a layout. Each box consists of four areas: the content area, padding, border, and margin.
The content-box value for the CSS box-sizing property makes the width and height of an element only include the content area, which is the area where text, images, or other data resides. On the other hand, the border-box value includes the padding and border in the element's width and height.

## difference between flex and grid

CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are both powerful layout models designed to solve different problems in web design. Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is primarily aimed at distributing space along a single column or row. CSS Grid Layout, on the other hand, provides a two-dimensional system for aligning items not only in rows but also in columns.

## What is BEM? (explain each part)

BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier. It is a methodology and naming convention for organizing and writing CSS in a way that makes CSS styles easier to understand and maintain.
Block: A standalone entity that is meaningful on its own, such as a header, container, or menu.
Element: A part of a block that performs a specific function. Elements are contextually tied to their block and have no standalone meaning. For instance, an item in a list block might be an element.
Modifier: A flag on a block or element that alters its appearance or behavior. For example, a button block might have a modifier that makes the button large or a different color.
