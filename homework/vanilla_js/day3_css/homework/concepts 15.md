### what is box model
box model is a layout of the web design in html, where every content stays in a box.

### content / padding / border / margin
content: the actual content of the box
padding: space between content and border
border: border that goes around padding and content, differentiate content from other stuff
margin: space between border and other elements

### content-box vs borderbox
content-box: width and height apply only to the content, not for padding, border, and margin
borderbox: width and height set apply to everything

### difference between flex and grid one dimensional / multi-dimensional
flex is one dimensional, grid is two dimensional

### how to do responsive web design
making website looks good on all devices, use media query to adjust and adapt on different
platforms, use flex when alignment is needed horizontally or vertically, use grid
for more complex layout.
