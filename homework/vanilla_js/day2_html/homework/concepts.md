# Homework: Answer Questions

### IP Address

Answer: Internet Protocol Address helps each computer find each other.

### Client vs Server Difference

Answer: Server is a special computer directly connect to the internet and responses the request from clients, but client not. Client connects to the internet by ISP (Internet Service Provider) and requests resources from server.

### What is CDN and why do we need it?

Answer: CDN(content delivery network) is designed for speeding up delivery of static HTML content globally.CDN can bring content closer to users by using hundreds of PoP (point of presence)to improve web service performance.
CDN has two benifits:

1.Security: offers robust DDoS protection by having a network with capacity much larger than the attackers 2. Availablity: increases the availability by having copies of content in many PoPs.

### Performance / Initial Load Time

Answer:IP address is a fundamental component of the Internet and networking, serving as both an identifier and a locator for devices connected to a network.

### Client vs Server difference

REST stands for Representational State Transfer, managing create, read, update, and delete operations. RESTful APIs are APIs that follow the REST architectural style.

Answer: A server is like a big computer in the background storing and managing data or services, while a client is your device (like a computer or phone) requesting and receiving things from the server

### What is CDN and why do we need it

Answer:GET:Retrieves data from the server
POST: Submit data to the server
UPDATE:Update data already on the server
DELETE: Deletes data from the server

keywords: performance / initial load time
<br>
Answer:CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver internet content quickly to users.
CDNs help improve website performance by reducing latency, optimizing bandwidth usage, and increasing reliability.They cache content in multiple locations around the world, allowing users to access content from the nearest server,reducing load time

### what are restful APIs

keywords: CRUD: get, post, delete, update
<br>
Answer:A RESTful API is a type of web service that follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), which is an architectural style for designing networked applications.It allow application and server to communicate with each other over the internet by using http method like
get,post,delete and update. Get means retrieving data from server; Post means creating new resource on server; delete means delete data on server;
update means change the data on server.

### what are some status codes

Answer: A semantic element describes its meaning to both browser and the developer.
Like header element, footer element and etc.

keywords: 200, 401, 403, 404
<br>
Answer:HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web servers on the internet to show the response to the request from client.
There are five different types of status code, starting from 1 , starting from 2 , starting from 3, starting from 4 and starting from 5.
Most common status code like 200 means success for the request; 400 means bad request, 401 means unauthorize; 403 means forbidden; 404 means not found;

### What is semantic HTML? Give examples

keywords: add meaning to tags / easier for developers & screen readers to understand
<br>
Answer:Semantic HTML means using tags with clear meaning to represent its usage to help developers and users easy to understand or read.
For example, like <header>,<nav>,<footer><article>.

### what are local storage vs session storage vs cookies

Answer:![local storage vs session storage vs cookie](image.png)
**Cookies**:
Storage Capacity: Limited to about 4 kilobytes.
Compatibility: Compatible with older browsers (HTML 4), but also support HTML 5.
Availability: Accessible across all tabs and windows.
Expiration Control: Cookies have expiration settings that can be configured by the developer.
Transmission: Sent to the server with each request, which can affect performance if not managed properly.
**Local Storage**: Benefits and Usage
Capacity: Can store up to 10 megabytes.
Persistence: Data remains until explicitly deleted by the user or via script.
Scope: Available across all sessions and tabs until cleared.
**Session Storage**: Session-Specific Data
Capacity: Up to 5 megabytes.
Session-Limited: Data is cleared once the session or tab is closed.
Isolation: Data is not shared across tabs or windows even on the same site.

keywords: size / duration / cookie: communication between client & server
<br>
Answer:
Local storage, session storage, and cookies are methods for storing data on the client-side.The size of cookie is pretty small like 4KB but local storage and session storage is much larger like 5 MB; The lift cycle between them are different. Cookie has limit expiration date after which it will be deleted,
local storage will remain permanently unless it is clear manually, session storage will be deleted once the browser closed.The last thing is cookies are sent with every HTTP request to the server to comunicate between client and server.

### What is accessibility and why is it important

Answer:Accessibility refers to designing and developing products and services that can be used by people of all abilities, including those with disabilities.It is important because it ensures that everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, can access and interact with digital content
