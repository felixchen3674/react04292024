### What is CDN and why do we need it?

Answer: CDN(content delivery network) is designed for speeding up delivery of static HTML content globally.CDN can bring content closer to users by using hundreds of PoP (point of presence)to improve web service performance.
CDN has two benifits:

1.Security: offers robust DDoS protection by having a network with capacity much larger than the attackers 2. Availablity: increases the availability by having copies of content in many PoPs.

### Performance / Initial Load Time

Answer:
CDN can enhance the peformance of web services by decreasing initial load time for users.Placing servers around world, known as PoPs will reduce the distances data needs to travel.

Answer:![local storage vs session storage vs cookie](image.png)
**Cookies**:
Storage Capacity: Limited to about 4 kilobytes.
Compatibility: Compatible with older browsers (HTML 4), but also support HTML 5.
Availability: Accessible across all tabs and windows.
Expiration Control: Cookies have expiration settings that can be configured by the developer.
Transmission: Sent to the server with each request, which can affect performance if not managed properly.
**Local Storage**: Benefits and Usage
Capacity: Can store up to 10 megabytes.
Persistence: Data remains until explicitly deleted by the user or via script.
Scope: Available across all sessions and tabs until cleared.
**Session Storage**: Session-Specific Data
Capacity: Up to 5 megabytes.
Session-Limited: Data is cleared once the session or tab is closed.
Isolation: Data is not shared across tabs or windows even on the same site.

### What is accessibility and why is it important?

Answer:Accessibility refers to the design and creation of websites and tools that are usable by people with disabilities. Ignoring accessibility can lead to lawsuits, as demonstrated by real-world examples like the Domino's Pizza case
