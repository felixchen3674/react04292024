# Homework: Answer Questions

### IP Address

Answer: Internet Protocol Address helps each computer find each other.


### Client vs Server Difference

Answer: Server is a special computer directly connect to the internet and responses the request from clients, but client not. Client connects to the internet by ISP (Internet Service Provider) and requests resources from server.

### What is CDN and why do we need it?

Answer: CDN(content delivery network) is designed for speeding up delivery of static HTML content globally.CDN can bring content closer to users by using hundreds of PoP (point of presence)to improve web service performance.
CDN has two benifits:

1.Security: offers robust DDoS protection by having a network with capacity much larger than the attackers 2. Availablity: increases the availability by having copies of content in many PoPs.

### Performance / Initial Load Time

Answer:
the unique identifying numerical label assigned to every device
that connects to the Internet.

### Client vs Server difference


REST stands for Representational State Transfer, managing create, read, update, and delete operations. RESTful APIs are APIs that follow the REST architectural style.

Answer:
Server is a computer connects to the Internet. It stores all the files need to
run the website. In other words, server provides services or resources to clients.
Client is a computer that requests services or resources from a server.

### What is CDN and why do we need it


Answer:GET:Retrieves data from the server
POST: Submit data to the server
UPDATE:Update data already on the server
DELETE: Deletes data from the server

keywords: performance / initial load time
<br>
Answer:
CDN is a network that distributes servers close to the user to deliver web content more
efficiently to users.

1. CDN can enhance security of web browsing.
2. CDN can improve performance and load times. When a user requests content, it is served
   from the nearest CDN server rather that the origin server. This reduce latency and improves load times.

### what are restful APIs

keywords: CRUD: get, post, delete, update
<br>
Answer:
Restful API is a interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet.
CRUD means 'Create', 'Read', 'Update', 'Delete', they are corresponding to the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.

### what are some status codes

<br>
Answer:
200: OK
401: Unauthorized
403: Forbidden
404: Not Found

### What is semantic HTML? Give examples

keywords: add meaning to tags / easier for developers & screen readers to understand
<br>
Answer:
Semantic HTML clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
examples of semantic HTML: <footer>, <header>, <form>, <table>

### what are local storage vs session storage vs cookies


Answer:![local storage vs session storage vs cookie](image.png)
**Cookies**:
Storage Capacity: Limited to about 4 kilobytes.
Compatibility: Compatible with older browsers (HTML 4), but also support HTML 5.
Availability: Accessible across all tabs and windows.
Expiration Control: Cookies have expiration settings that can be configured by the developer.
Transmission: Sent to the server with each request, which can affect performance if not managed properly.
**Local Storage**: Benefits and Usage
Capacity: Can store up to 10 megabytes.
Persistence: Data remains until explicitly deleted by the user or via script.
Scope: Available across all sessions and tabs until cleared.
**Session Storage**: Session-Specific Data
Capacity: Up to 5 megabytes.
Session-Limited: Data is cleared once the session or tab is closed.
Isolation: Data is not shared across tabs or windows even on the same site.

keywords: size / duration / cookie: communication between client & server
<br>
Answer:
They are all saved at the local browser.
Session Storage will be removed when the user closes the tab.
Cookies are sent to the server every time a user requests something from the server.
Local and session storage are never sent to the server.

### What is accessibility and why is it important

Answer:
The accessibility for web development refers to the practice of designing
and developing websites in a way that ensures they are usable and navigable by people with disabilities.
For example, the screen reader for blind users, the color contrast for low vision or color blindness users.
If we don't add accessibility on our web application, our website is not accessible for the disabled users,
and we might get lawsuit for not having accessibility in our website.
