### What is accessibility and why is it important?

Answer: Accessibility in coding means making sure that websites, apps, and other digital stuff can be easily used by everyone, including people with disabilities like vision or hearing issue. It's important because it lets everyone access and use the internet and technology without any barriers. It's like making sure that everyone can join in and use the same tools, no matter what challenges they might have. Example would be "text to talk" applications where 
deaf people could use text to talk and hear how the website is constructed and help to select correct place one would need to navigate.
