import React from 'react'

// this is your homework, create a custom hook "useFetch" to simplify the fetching process

// imagine you have to implement the same fetching, loading, and error logic for another component
// such as Comments, Todos, Users, etc. (if you are not sure what I'm talking about, just try to 
// create another component that fetches from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos, and you will
// find yourself rewriting the same logic)

export default function useFetch() {
  return (
    <div>useFetch</div>
  )
