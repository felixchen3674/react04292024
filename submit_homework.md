### STEP 1: Clone git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/felixchen3674/react04292024
```

### STEP 2: Navigate into folder and create a new branch 
`YOU ONLY HAVE TO DO THIS ONCE`
```
cd react04292024
git checkout -b [your_name]
```

### STEP 3 Install the dependencies for vanilla js homework
```
cd homework/vanilla_js
npm install
```

### STEP 4 For the current day's folder
1. homework
* Answer concept questions in concepts.md, put your loom recording link there too
* Do the homework, run the following command in root directory to run test (if any)
    *    ```npm run test```
* If there is a project homework, put your project in this folder
    
2. notes
* Your play-around code (scratch paper, however you want)
    * I should be able to tell you watched the lectures seriously and tried to follow along,
    just like how a student's scratch paper shows that he took the exam seriously
* Or you can put screenshots in this folder  

### STEP 5 Submitting homework
1. Use `git add .` to stage your changes
2. Use `git commit -m "message"` to commit
3. Use `git push` to update changes to your branch (if this is your first time, you need to publish the branch first)

## Getting updates 
Use `git pull` to get updates from the main branch
